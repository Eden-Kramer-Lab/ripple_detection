## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added

- **Critical UX Improvements**: Comprehensive input validation to prevent common user errors
  - Speed units validation: Warns when speed appears to be in m/s instead of cm/s, preventing silent data loss
  - Time units validation: Errors when time array appears to be in samples instead of seconds
  - Sampling frequency validation: Warns when time step doesn't match expected sampling rate
  - Array shape validation: Clear error messages for wrong LFP dimensions (1D, 0D, >2D arrays)
  - Array length validation: Detailed error showing exact sample counts when arrays don't match
  - Data length validation: Checks minimum data length required for filtering (954 samples)
  - Filter sampling frequency validation: Prevents crashes with incompatible sampling rates (<1200 Hz)

- **Enhanced Documentation**
  - Added comprehensive Troubleshooting section to README with solutions for common errors
  - Added Parameter Selection Guide table with recommended adjustment strategies
  - Added complete workflow example to `Kay_ripple_detector` docstring showing filtering â†’ detection steps
  - Clarified that `multiunit_HSE_detector` accepts both binary (0/1) and spike count formats
  - Added amplitude units documentation to `simulate_LFP` (arbitrary units with SNR guidance)
  - Bolded all unit specifications in docstrings (**seconds**, **cm/s**, **Hz**) for clarity

- **Improved Error Messages**
  - All new error messages follow WHAT/WHY/HOW pattern with actionable solutions
  - Errors include working code examples for fixing issues
  - Validation errors provide specific details (array shapes, sample counts, expected values)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `_preprocess_detector_inputs()` now requires `sampling_frequency` and `speed_threshold` parameters for validation (internal function, unlikely to affect users)
- Enhanced parameter descriptions across all detector functions with clearer units and adjustment guidance
- Improved `filter_ripple_band()` error handling to catch issues before scipy crashes

### Fixed

- Prevented cryptic numpy errors (`axis 1 is out of bounds`, `operands could not be broadcast`) with clear validation errors
- Fixed misleading filter warning-then-crash behavior for incompatible sampling frequencies
- Improved empty result guidance - docstrings now suggest specific parameter adjustments

## [1.5.1] - 2024-10-15

### Added
- Improved code formatting and organization
- Enhanced test coverage to 98%
- Added snapshot tests for detector outputs
- Improved type annotations with modern Python 3.10+ syntax

### Changed
- Refactored test suite for better organization
- Updated CI/CD for ruff and mypy integration
- Modernized type hints (using `|` instead of `Union`)
