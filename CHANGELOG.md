# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- NumPy 2.x compatibility: Fixed `AttributeError` when using `np.trapz` which was removed in NumPy 2.0 (now uses `np.trapezoid` with fallback for NumPy 1.x). Closes #10.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- **Flexible Signal Normalization**: New `normalize_signal()` function supporting both z-score (mean/std) and median/MAD normalization methods
  - Median/MAD normalization provides robust statistics less sensitive to outliers
  - Configurable normalization baseline via `normalization_mask` or `normalization_time_range` parameters
  - All detectors (`Kay_ripple_detector`, `Karlsson_ripple_detector`, `Roumis_ripple_detector`, `multiunit_HSE_detector`) now support these parameters
  - Enables advanced use cases: normalize during immobility only, use baseline period, exclude artifacts
  - Comprehensive test coverage including 23 new tests for normalization functionality

- **Tutorial Notebook**: Added `examples/ripple_detection_tutorial.ipynb` with step-by-step guide
  - Demonstrates basic ripple detection workflow
  - Shows how to use different normalization methods
  - Includes visualization examples

### Changed

- **Parameter Enhancement**: Added `normalization_method`, `normalization_mask`, and `normalization_time_range` parameters to all detector functions
  - Default behavior unchanged (z-score normalization on full signal)
  - New parameters provide fine-grained control over normalization baseline

### Deprecated

- `use_speed_threshold_for_zscore` parameter in `multiunit_HSE_detector`
  - Use `normalization_mask=speed < speed_threshold` instead for equivalent functionality
  - Deprecation warning added with migration guidance

### Fixed

- Updated README badges to reference release workflow and codecov
- Reformatted pyproject.toml for better readability

### Removed

- PR test GitHub Actions workflow (consolidated with main test workflow)

### Closed Issues

- Issue #8: Add support for using Median / MAD for ripple detection
- Issue #9: Allow users to customize where the mean and std come from

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added

- **Critical UX Improvements**: Comprehensive input validation to prevent common user errors
  - Speed units validation: Warns when speed appears to be in m/s instead of cm/s, preventing silent data loss
  - Time units validation: Errors when time array appears to be in samples instead of seconds
  - Sampling frequency validation: Warns when time step doesn't match expected sampling rate
  - Array shape validation: Clear error messages for wrong LFP dimensions (1D, 0D, >2D arrays)
  - Array length validation: Detailed error showing exact sample counts when arrays don't match
  - Data length validation: Checks minimum data length required for filtering (954 samples)
  - Filter sampling frequency validation: Prevents crashes with incompatible sampling rates (<1200 Hz)

- **Enhanced Documentation**
  - Added comprehensive Troubleshooting section to README with solutions for common errors
  - Added Parameter Selection Guide table with recommended adjustment strategies
  - Added complete workflow example to `Kay_ripple_detector` docstring showing filtering → detection steps
  - Clarified that `multiunit_HSE_detector` accepts both binary (0/1) and spike count formats
  - Added amplitude units documentation to `simulate_LFP` (arbitrary units with SNR guidance)
  - Bolded all unit specifications in docstrings (**seconds**, **cm/s**, **Hz**) for clarity

- **Improved Error Messages**
  - All new error messages follow WHAT/WHY/HOW pattern with actionable solutions
  - Errors include working code examples for fixing issues
  - Validation errors provide specific details (array shapes, sample counts, expected values)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `_preprocess_detector_inputs()` now requires `sampling_frequency` and `speed_threshold` parameters for validation (internal function, unlikely to affect users)
- Enhanced parameter descriptions across all detector functions with clearer units and adjustment guidance
- Improved `filter_ripple_band()` error handling to catch issues before scipy crashes

### Fixed

- Prevented cryptic numpy errors (`axis 1 is out of bounds`, `operands could not be broadcast`) with clear validation errors
- Fixed misleading filter warning-then-crash behavior for incompatible sampling frequencies
- Improved empty result guidance - docstrings now suggest specific parameter adjustments

## [1.5.1] - 2024-10-15

### Added
- Improved code formatting and organization
- Enhanced test coverage to 98%
- Added snapshot tests for detector outputs
- Improved type annotations with modern Python 3.10+ syntax

### Changed
- Refactored test suite for better organization
- Updated CI/CD for ruff and mypy integration
- Modernized type hints (using `|` instead of `Union`)
